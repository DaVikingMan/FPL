### FPL(Falcon Project License)
<pre>

Feel free to do whatever you want to do with this license.
<br>
- If you have any suggestions as to add to the license, you can create a pull request or a new issue to inform me about it
</pre>
Note : After reading some opensource licenses, it seems like this license isn't all that free and opensource as I aim it to be, therefore I won't be using this license anymore as it doesn't really fulfil the things which I wanted to create. A patch will be released to FalconXOS projects shortly which will replace this license to a different license. If you want to use this license, you can still do so as it will still be available in this repository
